Description: 
This project was done for the CMU course 16782 - Path Planning & Decision Making for Robots. The goal of this project was to develop and visualize a realtime planner within a 3D stadium that could identify the least cost path between a user's starting point and their seat given some waypoints (souvenir shops, bathrooms, etc.)they identify along the way. This problem was also dynamic by incoporating "dynamic crowdedness," which was the idea that part of the map will become more or less "crowded" due to people crowding certain traversable areas and increasing the time for the user to pass through said areas.
